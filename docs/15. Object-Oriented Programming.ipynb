    "## 1. Dunder (magic) methods and attributes. Operator overloading\n",
    "\n",
    "Dunder methods (short for \"double underscore methods\") and attributes in Python, also known as magic methods or special methods, are a set of predefined methods and attributes that begin and end with double underscores (`__`). These methods and attributes are used to provide special functionality to classes and objects, allowing for the customization of behavior in specific situations. Here's an overview:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dunder Methods\n",
    "Dunder methods allow you to define how objects of your classes behave with standard Python operations. Some common dunder methods include:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Initialization and Representation**\n",
    "   - `__init__(self, ...)`: Initializes a new instance of a class. Called when an object is created.\n",
    "   - `__repr__(self)`: Returns an official string representation of an object, typically one that can be used to recreate the object.\n",
    "   - `__str__(self)`: Returns a string representation of an object, used by the `print()` function.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Arithmetic Operations**\n",
    "   - `__add__(self, other)`: Defines behavior for the `+` operator.\n",
    "   - `__sub__(self, other)`: Defines behavior for the `-` operator.\n",
    "   - `__mul__(self, other)`: Defines behavior for the `*` operator.\n",
    "   - `__truediv__(self, other)`: Defines behavior for the `/` operator.\n",
    "   - `__floordiv__(self, other)`: Defines behavior for the `//` operator.\n",
    "   - `__mod__(self, other)`: Defines behavior for the `%` operator.\n",
    "   - `__pow__(self, other)`: Defines behavior for the `**` operator.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Comparison Operations**\n",
    "   - `__eq__(self, other)`: Defines behavior for the equality operator `==`.\n",
    "   - `__ne__(self, other)`: Defines behavior for the inequality operator `!=`.\n",
    "   - `__lt__(self, other)`: Defines behavior for the less-than operator `<`.\n",
    "   - `__le__(self, other)`: Defines behavior for the less-than-or-equal-to operator `<=`.\n",
    "   - `__gt__(self, other)`: Defines behavior for the greater-than operator `>`.\n",
    "   - `__ge__(self, other)`: Defines behavior for the greater-than-or-equal-to operator `>=`.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Container Methods**\n",
    "   - `__len__(self)`: Defines behavior for the `len()` function.\n",
    "   - `__getitem__(self, key)`: Defines behavior for indexing `obj[key]`.\n",
    "   - `__setitem__(self, key, value)`: Defines behavior for assignment to an index `obj[key] = value`.\n",
    "   - `__delitem__(self, key)`: Defines behavior for deleting an indexed value `del obj[key]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "For more examples on special methods see [this tutorial](https://diveintopython3.net/special-method-names.html) or the [official documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dunder Attributes\n",
    "Dunder attributes provide specific information about the class or its instances. Some common dunder attributes include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `__dict__`: A dictionary or other mapping object used to store an object’s (writable) attributes.\n",
    "- `__class__`: A reference to the class of the instance.\n",
    "- `__name__`: The name of the class or function.\n",
    "- `__module__`: The name of the module in which the class was defined.\n",
    "- `__bases__`: A tuple containing the base classes of a class.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Examples\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are a few examples to illustrate how dunder methods work:\n",

    "“Private” instance variables that cannot be accessed except from inside an object don’t exist in Python. However, there is a convention that is followed by most Python code: a name prefixed with an underscore (e.g. `_spam`) should be treated as a non-public part of the API (whether it is a function, a method or a data member). It should be considered an implementation detail and subject to change without notice.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since there is a valid use-case for class-private members (namely to avoid name clashes of names with names defined by subclasses), there is limited support for such a mechanism, called name mangling. Any identifier of the form `__spam` (at least two leading underscores, at most one trailing underscore) is textually replaced with `_classname__spam`, where `classname` is the current class name with leading underscore(s) stripped. This mangling is done without regard to the syntactic position of the identifier, as long as it occurs within the definition of a class.\n",

    "### Iterator\n",
    "\n",
    "Iterator is a behavioral design pattern that lets you traverse elements of a collection without exposing its underlying representation (list, stack, tree, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "Collections are one of the most used data types in programming. Nonetheless, a collection is just a container for a group of objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most collections store their elements in simple lists. However, some of them are based on stacks, trees, graphs and other complex data structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "But no matter how a collection is structured, it must provide some way of accessing its elements so that other code can use these elements. There should be a way to go through each element of the collection without accessing the same elements over and over.\n",
    "\n",
    "This may sound like an easy job if you have a collection based on a list. You just loop over all of the elements. But how do you sequentially traverse elements of a complex data structure, such as a tree? For example, one day you might be just fine with depth-first traversal of a tree. Yet the next day you might require breadth-first traversal. And the next week, you might need something else, like random access to the tree elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Adding more and more traversal algorithms to the collection gradually blurs its primary responsibility, which is efficient data storage. Additionally, some algorithms might be tailored for a specific application, so including them into a generic collection class would be weird.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, the client code that’s supposed to work with various collections may not even care how they store their elements. However, since collections all provide different ways of accessing their elements, you have no option other than to couple your code to the specific collection classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "The main idea of the Iterator pattern is to extract the traversal behavior of a collection into a separate object called an iterator.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to implementing the algorithm itself, an iterator object encapsulates all of the traversal details, such as the current position and how many elements are left till the end. Because of this, several iterators can go through the same collection at the same time, independently of each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "Usually, iterators provide one primary method for fetching elements of the collection. The client can keep running this method until it doesn’t return anything, which means that the iterator has traversed all of the elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "All iterators must implement the same interface. This makes the client code compatible with any collection type or any traversal algorithm as long as there’s a proper iterator. If you need a special way to traverse a collection, you just create a new iterator class, without having to change the collection or the client."
