    "# 3. Control Flow\n",
    "\n",
    "Control flow refers to the order in which the statements in a program are executed. It determines how the program's instructions are processed based on certain conditions or decision points. In essence, control flow dictates the path that the program takes during its execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several key elements of control flow:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Sequential Execution**: This is the default behavior of a program, where statements are executed one after the other in the order they appear in the code.\n",
    "- **Conditional Execution**: Conditional statements, such as `if` statements, allow the program to execute certain blocks of code only if specific conditions are met. Depending on whether a condition evaluates to true or false, the program follows different paths.\n",
    "- **Looping**: Looping constructs, such as `for` loops and `while` loops, enable the program to execute a block of code repeatedly as long as certain conditions are true. This allows for efficient repetition of tasks without the need for duplicate code.\n",
    "- **Branching**: Branching statements, like `break` and `continue`, provide mechanisms to alter the flow of control within loops. They allow for early termination of loops or skipping iterations.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3.1. Conditional Statement (`if-elif-else`)\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, conditional statements are used to execute certain blocks of code based on whether a specific _condition_ is true or false. The condition can be as simple as a variable, or it can be a more complex expression that can be evaluated as true or false. \n",
    "\n",
    "The syntax of a simple conditional statement in Python is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "if condition:\n",
    "    statement_1\n",
    "    ...\n",
    "    statement_n\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice the whitespace at the beginning of `statement_1 ... statement_n`. This is called indentation. While other programming languages use curly brackets to group together statements in the same block of statements, Python uses indentation. This contributes to a higher readability of the program. In order to end the `if` statement, you simply return to the previous indentation level.\n",
    "\n",
    "What can be used as a _condition_ in an `if` statement?\n",
    "- comparison between values\n",
    "- boolean values\n",
    "- boolean expressions\n",
    "- expressions containing other operators (e.g. `in` and `not in`)\n",
    "- function/method calls\n",
    "- more generally, anything that can be evaluated as true or false\n"
